I had to create an alternative website that contains six pages for one of the local companies in Uzbekistan to complete my coursework. I chose "Unical," which offers creating and designing complex web projects, applications for mobile devices, and e-commerce stores. On the first page of the website, which is Home, I included brief information about the mission of the company, some projects that the company has completed, and the features that the company offers. Then, on the About page, I provided their approach to solving problems and the team members of the company. The third page, Pricing, contains information about the different packages and pricing options available for clients to choose from and answers to frequently asked questions. On the Work page, you will find all the portfolios showcasing the company's past projects. On the Blog page, a user can access articles and insights written by the company's experts on various topics related to their industry. The final page of the website, Contact Us, includes a convenient contact form that allows users to easily submit their messages and receive a prompt response from the company's team. Additionally, the footer section of all pages provides the company's contact information, including a phone number and email address, for users who prefer to reach out directly, and Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn links for users to connect with the company on social media platforms. Overall, I have learned how to build a responsive website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which has greatly enhanced my web development skills. These languages have allowed me to create dynamic and interactive elements on the website.
